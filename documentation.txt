# Backend Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This backend project is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It includes authentication, product management, inventory management, and invoice generation functionalities.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or using yarn
yarn install
```

### 3. Create a `.env` File

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file contains environment variables used for configuration.

Create a file named `.env` and add the following content:

```plaintext
JWT_KEY=abc127876jhsdgjkash
PORT=5400
USER=baitulamin1900
PASSWORD=2O9bhZ2BMTiscFun
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://baitulamin1900:2O9bhZ2BMTiscFun@cluster0.gnx9huc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details if they differ.

### 4. Start the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start-dev
# or using yarn
yarn run start-dev
```

The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (`PORT=5400`).
