Project Overview
This backend project is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It includes features like user authentication, inventory management, and invoice generation.

Project Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already cloned the repository, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# or using yarn
yarn install
3. Create a .env File
You will need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project. This file contains environment variables used for configuration.

Create a file named .env and add the following content:

plaintext
Copy code
JWT_KEY=abc127876jhsdgjkash
PORT=5400
USER=baitulamin1900
PASSWORD=2O9bhZ2BMTiscFun
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://baitulamin1900:2O9bhZ2BMTiscFun@cluster0.gnx9huc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details if they differ.

4. Start the Server
To start the server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run start-dev
# or using yarn
yarn run start-dev
The server will start on the port specified in your .env file (PORT=5400).

5. Running Tests
If you have tests set up for your project, you can run them using:

bash
Copy code
npm test
# or using yarn
yarn test
Environment Variables
Here's a breakdown of the environment variables used in the .env file:

JWT_KEY: Secret key used for signing JWT tokens.
PORT: Port number on which the server will run.
USER: Database username for MongoDB.
PASSWORD: Database password for MongoDB.
MONGO_URL: MongoDB connection string.
Common Issues and Troubleshooting
Issue: Error: MONGO_URL is not defined
Solution: Make sure the .env file exists and contains the correct MONGO_URL value.

Issue: Cannot find module 'express'
Solution: Run npm install or yarn install to ensure all dependencies are installed.

Issue: JWT_TOKEN is invalid
Solution: Ensure that JWT_KEY in the .env file matches the key used in your code.

Useful Commands
Start Server: npm start
Install Dependencies: npm install
Run Tests: npm test
Example of .env File
plaintext
Copy code
JWT_KEY=abc127876jhsdgjkash
PORT=5400
USER=baitulamin1900
PASSWORD=2O9bhZ2BMTiscFun
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://baitulamin1900:2O9bhZ2BMTiscFun@cluster0.gnx9huc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
Make sure to keep your .env file private and do not commit it to version control. Use a .gitignore file to ignore it:

plaintext
Copy code
